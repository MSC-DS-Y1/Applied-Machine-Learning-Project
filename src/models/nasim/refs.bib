abstract="This work aims to contribute to the reduction of academic failure at higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. A dataset from a higher education institution is used to build classification models to predict academic performance of students. The dataset includes information known at the time of student's enrollment -- academic path, demographics and social-economic factors. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there's a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. Algorithms to promote class balancing with synthetic oversampling are tested, and classification models are trained and evaluated, both with standard machine learning algorithms and state of the art boosting algorithms. Our results show that boosting algorithms respond better to the specific classification task than standard methods. However, even these state of the art algorithms fall short in correctly identifying the majority of cases in one of the minority classes. Future directions of this study include the addition of information regarding student's first year performance, such as academic grades from the first academic semesters.",

ABSTRACT = {Higher education institutions record a significant amount of data about their students, representing a considerable potential to generate information, knowledge, and monitoring. Both school dropout and educational failure in higher education are an obstacle to economic growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education institutions, and society as a whole. The dataset described here results from the aggregation of information from different disjointed data sources and includes demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and academic data on enrollment and academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The dataset is used to build machine learning models for predicting academic performance and dropout, which is part of a Learning Analytic tool developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre that provides information to the tutoring team with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. The dataset is useful for researchers who want to conduct comparative studies on student academic performance and also for training in the machine learning area.},
